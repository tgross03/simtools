# SimTools Framework

## Introduction

A framework to simplify and unify the simulation process of radiointerferometric measurments using the two simulation softwares
`casatasks` which is part of the [CASA](http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1538-3873/ac9642) software package developed by the NRAO and 
the python package [`pyvisgen`](https://github.com/radionets-project/pyvisgen), which is part of the [`radionets-project`](https://github.com/radionets-project).

## Installation

To install and use the package it is necessary to execute the following command inside the `simtools` directory:

``` 
$ pip install -e .
```
Since the `casatasks`, `casatools` and `casadata` pypi packages only support `python=3.10` it is recommended to use this version.
